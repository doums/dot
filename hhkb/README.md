## Custom XKB layout

This is my own X keyboard extension (XKB) layout. It is a custom azerty layout purely dedicated to the the Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2 model (by PFU).

All the unnecessary stuff has been removed to keep only the essentials (thanks to my reverse engineering ego-trip to the XKB rabbit hole).

It retains all the advantages provided by the physical layout of the HHKB but switch from qwerty to azerty (I'm french) and makes theses adjustments :
```
RightAlt + w gives <
RightAlt + x gives >
```

### install

```
sudo ./install.sh
```
