## Custom XKB layout

This is my own X keyboard extension (XKB) layout. It is a custom azerty layout purely dedicated to the the Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2 model (by PFU).

All the unnecessary stuff has been cleaned (thanks to my reverse engineering ego-trip to the XKB rabbit hole).

It retains all the advantages provided by the physical layout of the HHKB but switch from qwerty to azerty (I'm french) and makes a few adjustments, especially
```
RightAlt + w gives <
RightAlt + x gives >
```

### install

```
sudo ./install.sh
```
